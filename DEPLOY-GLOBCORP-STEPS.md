3. After login, click **"Add new site"** ‚Üí **"Deploy manually"**
4. **Drag and drop** your entire `KCTT` folder into the deployment area

### Step 2: Add Your Custom Domain

2. Go to **"Domain management"**
3. Click **"Add custom domain"**
4. Enter: `globcorp.com`

6. Also add `www.globcorp.com` (click "Add custom domain" again)

### Step 3: Configure DNS (Most Important Step)

**Add these DNS records:**

| Type  | Name | Value                      | TTL  |
| ----- | ---- | -------------------------- | ---- |
| A     | @    | 75.2.60.5                  | Auto |
